# Architecture Index

This index lists all architecture documents in strict numerical order,
using **filenames** as the canonical identifiers.  
Human-readable titles are provided for clarity, but filenames govern structure.

## Notes

- Filename numbering is authoritative and must be maintained as the architecture expands.  
- Items marked **(planned)** are intentionally left for upcoming documentation passes.  
- Items marked **(future)** are long-range and do not constrain v1 implementation.
