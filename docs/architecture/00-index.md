# Architecture Index

This index lists all architecture documents in section-based alphanumeric order,
using **filenames** as the canonical identifiers.  
Human-readable titles are provided for clarity, but filenames govern structure.

## Notes

- Filename numbering uses section-based alphanumeric prefixes (A–F) to avoid global renumbering when new documents are added.  
- Items marked **(planned)** are intentionally left for upcoming documentation passes.  
- Items marked **(future)** are long-range and do not constrain v1 implementation.
